# Simple Login Program

## Overview
This project is a Python-based console application that implements a simple login system. It allows users to register with a username and password and log in with their credentials.

## Features
- **User Registration:** Users can create accounts by providing a unique username and password.
- **Login Functionality:** Users can log in with their registered credentials.
- **Data Storage:** User information is stored securely in a file (or optionally, in a database).
- **Password Validation:** Ensures secure password requirements (e.g., minimum length, character variety).

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - `os` for file operations
  - `hashlib` for password hashing (optional for added security)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/simple-login-program.git
   cd simple-login-program
   ```

2. Install Python (if not already installed):
   Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage
1. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   python login.py
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Choose `Register` to create a new account.
   - Choose `Login` to access an existing account.

3. **User Data:**
   User credentials are stored in `users_data.txt` in a simple format (or hashed for security if implemented).

## Example Flow
1. Registration:
   ```
   Welcome to the Login System!
   1. Register
   2. Login
   Enter your choice: 1
   Enter a username: user123
   Enter a password: ********
   Registration successful!
   ```

2. Login:
   ```
   Welcome to the Login System!
   1. Register
   2. Login
   Enter your choice: 2
   Enter your username: user123
   Enter your password: ********
   Login successful! Welcome, user123!
   ```

## Security Notes
- Passwords should ideally be hashed using a library like `hashlib` for better security.
- Ensure `users_data.txt` is not publicly accessible.
